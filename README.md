## Uncle Kesh | Cloud & DevOps Engineer

Designing resilient cloud platforms where deployments are automated, infrastructure is reproducible, Reliabile, secure, and Independent service deployment. Services remain available even when components fail.

## About Me

I build AWS infrastructure focused on:

Reliability

Automation

Security

Independent service deployment

My work centers on designing systems that behave like modern production environments — minimizing downtime and deployment risk through Infrastructure as Code and secure CI/CD practices.

## Featured Project — Fault-Isolated ECS Platform

ECS 4-Part Independent Deployment

https://github.com/unclekesh101/ECS-4-part-deployment

Production-style AWS architecture demonstrating:

* Independent microservice deployments

* Terraform-provisioned infrastructure

* GitHub Actions OIDC authentication (no AWS keys)

* Zero-downtime ECS rolling deployments

* ALB path-based routing

* Failure isolation design

## Cloud-Native CI/CD on AWS EKS

Production-ready EKS with Terraform, IRSA, ALB, and CI/CD

## Kubernetes, Networking and Security

* Deployed workloads to EKS with rolling updates

* Exposed the app using AWS Load Balancer Controller

* Automatically provisioned an internet‑facing ALB

* Used **IRSA** for AWS Load Balancer Controller

* Used **GitHub Actions OIDC** instead of AWS access keys

* Implemented least‑privilege IAM roles

**Analogy:**

> Terraform is the blueprint, GitHub Actions is the robot, Kubernetes is the factory, AWS is the land.
